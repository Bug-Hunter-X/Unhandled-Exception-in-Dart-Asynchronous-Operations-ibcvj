# Unhandled Exception in Dart Asynchronous Operations

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart asynchronous programming: neglecting to handle exceptions thrown in asynchronous operations within the main function's execution flow.  The `bug.dart` file shows the initial code with the error, and `bugSolution.dart` demonstrates how to properly handle exceptions to prevent crashes.
